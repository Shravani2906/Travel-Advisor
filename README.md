#  Travel Advisor AI  

A simple web-based travel recommendation system built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It asks users about their **travel preferences** (location type, season, activity, budget, and travel type) and suggests the best destination accordingly.

This project is great for:  
- Beginners learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- Understanding **form handling and DOM manipulation**  
- Practicing **conditional logic** for recommendation systems

## How It Works  

1. The user selects travel preferences (e.g., **National trip, Winter, Snow, Medium budget, Adventure**)  
2. The system checks these preferences against a **destination database** (in JavaScript)  
3. A **matching destination** is displayed, or an error message if none matches  

Example:  
- Preferences: *National + Winter + Snow + Medium + Adventure*  
- Recommendation: **Manali**
